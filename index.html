            Dear sir,
        </p>
        <p>
            I am excited to submit my application for the Front-end Web
            Developer position at BemsSoft. With four years of experience
            in ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Bootstrap, I am confident
            in my ability to contribute to your team's success.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a front-end web developer, I am proficient in programming languages such as Javascript,
            HTML, and Java/Kotlin for Android UI development. I also have the fundamental knowledge in
            Back-end coding using Node, MongoDb and some other libraries for user authentication.
            My experience in REST APIs also enables me to
            efficiently communicate with back-end developers to ensure
            seamless functionality of web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout my career, I have developed and maintained responsive and user-friendly websites and web
            applications. My expertise in ReactJS has allowed me
            to create high-quality interfaces that are both aesthetically
            pleasing and efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices with
            the field. I believe that staying current in technology is vital
            in delivering optimal results for clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am confident that my skills, experience, and passion for front-end web development make me an ideal candidate
            for the position. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute
            to your team and grow as a professional at BemsSoft.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to work with this company and
	        see it excel, as I will contribute immensely to its success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,
        </p>
        <p>
            Anuma Thomas.
